An inverting amplifier is a type of operational amplifier circuit configuration that produces an output that is the negative of the input signal. In other words, if the input signal increases, the output signal decreases by the same amount, and vice versa.

The basic inverting amplifier circuit consists of an operational amplifier (op-amp) with a feedback resistor connected between the output and the inverting input of the op-amp, and an input resistor connected between the inverting input and the input signal source. The output of the circuit is taken from the output of the op-amp.

When a voltage is applied to the input resistor, a current flows through the resistor and into the inverting input of the op-amp. This causes the op-amp to produce an output voltage that is negative and proportional to the input voltage. The feedback resistor amplifies this negative voltage and feeds it back to the inverting input of the op-amp, causing the output voltage to become even more negative.

The gain of the inverting amplifier is determined by the ratio of the feedback resistor to the input resistor. A higher value of feedback resistor relative to input resistor results in a higher gain. The inverting amplifier can be used in a variety of applications, such as audio amplifiers, signal conditioning circuits, and voltage regulators.
