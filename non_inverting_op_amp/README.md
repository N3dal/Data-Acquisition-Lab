# Non-Inverting Opertional Amplifier

A non-inverting op amp is a type of operational amplifier circuit in which the output signal is in phase with the input signal. This means that the output voltage of the op amp is amplified and appears at the output terminal with the same polarity as the input voltage. The non-inverting configuration is commonly used in applications where a high input impedance is required, as well as in cases where a voltage gain greater than one is needed.

The circuit consists of an op amp, two resistors, and an input signal. The input signal is applied to the non-inverting input terminal of the op amp, while the inverting input terminal is connected to ground. The feedback resistor is connected between the output and the non-inverting input terminal, while the other resistor is connected between the non-inverting input terminal and ground.

The gain of the non-inverting amplifier is calculated by dividing the feedback resistor value by the sum of the two resistors. The output voltage is equal to the input voltage multiplied by the gain. The non-inverting configuration has a high input impedance, which makes it suitable for use in applications where a low current is available from the source.

Non-inverting op amps are commonly used in audio and instrumentation applications, as well as in active filter circuits and voltage regulators. They can also be used in buffer circuits, which provide isolation between the input and output signals.
